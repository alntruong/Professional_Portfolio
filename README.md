# Professional_Portfolio
This assignent required us to design our own functioning portfolio. The about page contains an image placeholder of where I plan to input an image of myself as well as a brief description of my educational background. The portfolio page contains 3 projects of which I pulled from another individual's portfolio that I found online because I have not done any projects of my own [yet]. The contact page has 2 buttons that I created that are linked to my Github and Linkedin profile, but if they prefer to reach me via email, then the box beneath would give them the option to do so, although I would like to disclose that I was unsure how to do so.
